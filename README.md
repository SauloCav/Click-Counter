## Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/react-native-click-counter.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd react-native-click-counter
   ```

3. Install the dependencies using npm or yarn:

   Using npm:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

   Using yarn:

   ```bash
   yarn install
   ```

## Usage

After installing the dependencies, you can start the application on an emulator or real device. Make sure your emulator is running or your device is connected via USB.

Command to start the application:

```bash
npx react-native run-android # For Android
